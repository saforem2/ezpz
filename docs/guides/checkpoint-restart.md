# Checkpoint & Restart Under Failure

How `ezpz.examples.fsdp_tp` behaves when training is interrupted: how it
saves distributed checkpoints, resumes automatically, and how much a
restart-from-checkpoint actually costs — with **real measurements from
Sunspot** (Intel PVC / XPU), not modeled estimates.

!!! info "Key API"
    - [`ezpz.examples._checkpoint`](../python/Code-Reference/examples/fsdp_tp.md) — DCP save/load helpers
    - `fsdp_tp` flags: `--ckpt-dir`, `--save-interval`, `--train-iters`, `--no-resume`
    - Metric: `train/restart_seconds`

## How it works

`fsdp_tp` uses PyTorch **Distributed Checkpoint (DCP)** — each rank writes
its own shard in parallel (no gather-to-rank-0 that would OOM at scale), so
it works identically under FSDP-only, HSDP, and 2D FSDP+TP.

- **Save** every `--save-interval` steps into `--ckpt-dir/step-<N>/`. A
  `.complete` marker is written **last**, so a checkpoint interrupted
  mid-save (e.g. by the failure you're recovering from) is skipped.
- **Resume** is automatic on startup: the newest complete checkpoint is
  loaded and training continues from its step — no flag needed (pass
  `--no-resume` to force a fresh run).

Because resume is automatic, it composes directly with
[`ezpz launch --auto-retry`](../cli/launch/index.md): a relaunch simply
resumes.

```bash
ezpz launch --auto-retry --np <N> -- \
  python3 -m ezpz.examples.fsdp_tp --model debug \
    --ckpt-dir ./ckpts --save-interval 100 --train-iters 3000
```

### Asynchronous checkpointing

By default a save is **synchronous** — the training loop blocks while every
rank writes its shards to the durable `--ckpt-dir`. At large model sizes that
stall recurs every `--save-interval` steps. Pass `--async-ckpt` to overlap the
write with training:

```bash
python3 -m ezpz.examples.fsdp_tp ... \
    --ckpt-dir /shared/ckpts --async-ckpt \
    --ckpt-stage-dir /tmp/ezpz-ckpt --save-interval 100
```

`--async-ckpt` uses `dcp.async_save`: the state dict is staged to CPU memory
**synchronously** (so it's safe to keep training the instant the call
returns), then written to fast **node-local** `--ckpt-stage-dir` (default
`/tmp/ezpz-ckpt-<jobid>`) by a background thread, and finally **fanned out**
to the durable `--ckpt-dir` on shared FS. The only cost on the training
thread is the short staging copy (logged + tracked as
`train/ckpt_stage_seconds`).

!!! warning "Node-local staging is not durable"
    `--ckpt-stage-dir` (e.g. `/tmp`) is node-local and **not resumable on its
    own** — its shards are scattered per node and it carries no completion
    marker. Only the fanned-out `--ckpt-dir` copy on shared FS survives a node
    failure, and resume always reads from there. That's why `--async-ckpt`
    *requires* `--ckpt-dir`; `/tmp` is a staging tier, not the checkpoint.

## The experiment

To measure restart cost we ran two 3000-step jobs on **2 Sunspot nodes (24
XPU ranks, `tp=2`)**, checkpointing every 100 steps:

1. **Baseline** — no failures.
2. **Checkpoint Restart** — a background loop `SIGKILL`s the training ranks
   across all nodes every ~90 s (a real `pkill -9`; PALS then tears down the
   training `mpiexec`, each attempt exiting rc=137). A relaunch loop restarts
   on the same nodes and `fsdp_tp` auto-resumes from the last checkpoint.

## Results

| | Baseline | Checkpoint Restart |
|---|---:|---:|
| Steps | 3000 | 3000 |
| Wall-clock | **5.81 min** | **8.04 min** |
| Failures | 0 | 4 (real SIGKILL) |
| Recovery overhead | — | **+2.23 min (≈38%)** |

Per failure (kill → PALS teardown → relaunch → DCP resume):

| # | resume @ step | lost steps | `restart_seconds` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 801 | 71 | 10.40 |
| 2 | 1301 | 57 | 10.66 |
| 3 | 1801 | 57 | 10.79 |
| 4 | 2301 | 59 | 11.10 |

**What the numbers mean:**

- **Restart cost ≈ 10.4–11.1 s**, strikingly consistent. `train/restart_seconds`
  is timed from process entry (before `setup_torch`), so it captures the full
  cold path: process launch + distributed init + model build + `dcp.load` +
  first productive step.
- **Lost steps ≈ 57–71**, bounded by the 100-step checkpoint interval — you
  only ever redo work since the last checkpoint. Shrink `--save-interval` to
  reduce lost work (at the cost of more frequent save I/O).
- **≈ 33 s total per failure** (~11 s restart + ~22 s recomputing lost steps),
  which is the +2.23 min overhead across 4 failures.

## Measuring it yourself

`fsdp_tp` logs a `RESUMED from step=N` line on resume and a
`train/restart_seconds` metric on the first post-resume step (into the
metrics JSONL and W&B). The driver script + a reusable plotter live in the
repo under `experiments/checkpoint-restart/`:

```bash
qsub experiments/checkpoint-restart/restart_experiment.pbs   # 2 nodes
python3 experiments/checkpoint-restart/plot_restart.py \
    expt_<jobid>/baseline/*/metrics-0.jsonl \
    expt_<jobid>/restart/*/*/metrics-0.jsonl \
    --out restart_plot.png --report restart_report.md
```

## Scope

This shows the two behaviors ezpz provides natively: a **baseline** and
**checkpoint restart** (fail → lose steps to the last checkpoint → resume).
Frameworks that recover *without* losing steps or *without* a process
restart — e.g. pause/resume or in-place elastic recovery (TorchFT-style) —
are separate systems not integrated into ezpz and are out of scope here.

Numbers above are from Sunspot job `12471687` (debug model, 2 nodes). Absolute
`restart_seconds` grows with model size and node count (larger `dcp.load`,
longer init); the *mechanism* is parallelism-agnostic since DCP is sharded.
