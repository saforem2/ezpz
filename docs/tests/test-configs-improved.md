# Improved Configs Tests

## Overview

`tests/test_configs_improved.py` supplements the original configs test suite with
additional smoke checks that run under heavy mocking. These tests confirm the
configuration helpers continue to behave when scheduler detection is overridden
or when only the minimal environment is present.

## Highlights

- **Command existence** – Verifies `ezpz.configs.command_exists` returns a
  boolean for both present and missing commands without raising.
- **Logging configuration** – Ensures the YAML-derived logging dictionary still
  contains the expected keys when scheduler information is mocked out.
- **Path constants & scheduler tables** – Confirms the foundational path
  constants (`HERE`, `PROJECT_DIR`, `CONF_DIR`, `BIN_DIR`) remain available and
  that scheduler/framework/backend dictionaries are defined.

## Running the Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_configs_improved.py
```
